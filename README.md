## Workflow
Current Colony Beta product is integrated in `master` branch, which is used in `colonyDapp` repo. 
The new release implementing the whitepaper is integrated in `develop` branch. 
Changes in `master` are not necessarity reverse integrated in `develop` as contract architecture will potentially differ significantly.

The rest of the workflow follows `git-flow` similarly to `colonyDapp`, namely:
Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases? - [master]
Which branch should be used for integration of the "next release"? [develop]
How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/] 
Release branches? [release/] 
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/] 
Support branches? [support/] 
Version tag prefix? []
